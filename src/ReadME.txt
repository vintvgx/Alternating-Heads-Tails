There are N coins, each showing either heads or tails. We would like all the coins to form a sequence of alternating heads and tails. What is the minimum number of coins that must be reversed to achieve this?

Write a function:
    class Solution {public int solution (int[] A); }
that, given an array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the minimum number of coins that must be reversed. Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins and contain either a 0 (heads) or a 1 (tails).

Example: Given array A = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], the function should return 1. After reversing the sixth coin, we achieve an alternating sequence of coins [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
